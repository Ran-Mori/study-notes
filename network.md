# Network

## Introduction

* Routers are the building blocks of WANs. The largest WAN today is the Internet. Many companies build their own WANs and these private WANs may or may not be connected to the Internet.

## A Simple Daytime Client

### sa_family

* `AF_INET` is an address family that is used to designate the type of addresses that your socket can communicate with (in this case, Internet Protocol v4 addresses). 
* `AF_UNIX`、`AF_IMPLINK`、`AF_PUP`……

### differences of the term socket

* the API that we are using is called the sockets API
* a function named socket that is part of the sockets API
* a TCP socket, which is synonymous with a TCP endpoint.

### inet_pton function

* to convert an ASCII dotted-decimal string into the correct format

### read

* `while ( (n = read(sockfd, recvline, MAXLINE)) > 0) { //... }`
* Normally, a single segment containing all 26 bytes of data is returned, but with larger data sizes, we cannot assume that the server's reply will be returned by a single read.

### record boundaries

* TCP  is a *byte-stream* protocol with no record boundaries.
* In this example, the end of the record is being denoted by the server closing the connection.This technique is also used by version 1.0 of HTTP.
* Other techniques are available. For example, the SMTP marks the end of a record with the two-byte sequence of an ASCII carriage return followed by an ASCII linefeed.
* The important concept here is that TCP itself provides no record markers: If an application wants to delineate the ends of records, it must do so itself and there are a few common ways to accomplish this.

### terminate program

* Unix always closes all open descriptors when a process terminates, so our TCP socket is now closed.

### Protocol-Dependen

* Our program in Figure 1.5 is *protocol-dependent* on IPv4. We allocate and initialize a sockaddr_in structure, we set the family of this structure to AF_INET, and we specify the first argument to socket as AF_INET.
* To modify the program to work under IPv6, we must change the code.

### A Simple Daytime Server

* Bind server's well-known port to socket
  * `Bind(listenfd, (SA *) &servaddr, sizeof(servaddr));`
* Convert socket to listening socket
  * By calling listen, the socket is converted into a listening socket

***

## OSI Model

* The sockets programming interfaces described in this book are interfaces from the upper three layers (the application) into the transport layer. Or the upper one layer in five layers network models.
* TCP/IP are implemented in kernel. And the data will be copied between kernel and user process.

### layer

* application
* tcp/udp
* ipv4/ipv6

### raw socket

* an application to bypass tcp and use IPv4 or IPv6 directly

### focus of this book

* how to write applications using sockets that use either TCP or UDP

### reason for the interface of socket

* application knows little about the communication details. The lower four layers know little about the application, but handle all the communication details:ending data, waiting for acknowledgments, sequencing data that arrives out of order, calculating and verifying checksums, and so on.
* application what is called a *user process* while the lower four layers are normally provided as part of the operating system (OS) kernel.

***

## I/O Models

### five I/O models

1. blocking I/O

2. nonblocking I/O

3. I/O multiplexing

   1. select

   2. poll

   3. epoll or kqueue

4. signal driven I/O (SIGIO)

5. asynchronous I/O (the POSIX aio_functions)

### blocking I/O

* the process calls the system call (read, write), and it does not return until the data arrives, or an error occurs. 

### nonblocking I/O

* It equals to `poll(轮询)`. The application is continually polling the kernel to see if some operation is ready. 
* When an I/O operation that I request cannot be completed, do not put the process to sleep, but return an error instead.

### signal driven I/O (SIGIO)

* Using signals to tell the kernel to notify us with the SIGIO signal when the descriptor is ready.
* progress
  * install a signal handler using the `sigaction` system call. The return from this system call is immediate and our process continues; it is not blocked.
  * the specified signal is generated for our process when deciptor is ready
  * handle the signal
* it is just the same as `handler in android`

***

## select

### what is it

* a standard system call in Unix-like operating systems.

### what it does

* This function allows the process to instruct the kernel to wait for any one of multiple events to occur and to wake up the process only when one or more of these events occurs or when a specified amount of time has passed. 

### definition

* `int select(int maxfdp, fd_set readset, fd_set writeset, fd_set exceptset, const struct timeval timeout)`
* args
  * maxfdp - the highest-numbered file descriptor in any of the three sets, plus 1.   
* returns
  * success - the number of file descriptors contained in the three returned descriptor sets.
  * 
    if the timeout expired before any file descriptors became ready. - zero
  * error - -1
* if first three arguments are all null, then it is a higher precision timer than the normal Unix `sleep` function.

### condition of read descriptor ready

* The number of bytes of data in the socket receive/send buffer is greater than

  or equal to the current size of the low-water mark for the socket receive buffer.

* The read half of the connection is closed.

### example

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <sys/select.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
  fd_set readfds;
  FD_ZERO(&readfds);
  FD_SET(STDIN_FILENO, &readfds); // set the standard input file descriptor

  struct timeval timeout;
  timeout.tv_sec = 5; // set the timeout to 5 seconds
  timeout.tv_usec = 0;

  int num_ready = select(STDIN_FILENO + 1, &readfds, NULL, NULL, &timeout);
  if (num_ready == -1) {
    std::cerr << "Error occurred during select system call\n";
    return 1;
  } else if (num_ready == 0) {
    std::cout << "Timeout occurred\n";
  } else {
    if (FD_ISSET(STDIN_FILENO, &readfds)) {
      std::cout << "Data is available on standard input\n";
      char input[1024];
      std::cin.getline(input, sizeof(input));
      std::cout << "You entered: " << input << "\n";
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

***

## poll

### what is ?

* it is a syterm call.
* it is part of the POSIX standard. it is available on POSIX-compliant operating systems, such as Linux and Unix.

### definition

* `int poll(struct pollfd *fds, nfds_t nfds, int timeout);`
* parameter
  * nfds - the number of items in the fds array in nfds.
* return: count of ready descriptors, 0 on timeout, –1 on error

### pollfd

```c
struct pollfd {
	int     fd; 
	short   events; // interested events, such as reading, writting
	short   revents; // events that really currently happens
};
```

### example

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <sys/poll.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    int fd = STDIN_FILENO; // File descriptor to monitor (standard input)
    struct pollfd fds[1];
    fds[0].fd = fd;
    fds[0].events = POLLIN; // Monitor input events

    while (true) {
        int ret = poll(fds, 1, -1); // Wait indefinitely for an event
        if (ret < 0) {
            std::cerr << "poll error\n";
            break;
        }
        if (fds[0].revents & POLLIN) {
            std::cout << "input available\n";
            char buf[256];
            int n = read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf));
            if (n < 0) {
                std::cerr << "read error\n";
                break;
            }
            if (n == 0) {
                std::cout << "end of input\n";
                break;
            }
            buf[n] = '\0';
            std::cout << "read " << n << " bytes: " << buf << '\n';
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## epoll

### what is?

* it is is a Linux kernel system call.
* it is a Linux-specific interface.

### if not Linux?

*  `kqueue` on FreeBSD and macOS
* `IOCP` on Windows
*  `/dev/poll` on Solaris

### definition

* `int epoll_create1(int flags);`
  * return - its file descriptor
* `int epoll_ctl(int epfd, int op, int fd, struct epoll_event *event);`
  * param op - can be ADD, MODIFY or DELETE.
* `int epoll_wait(int epfd, struct epoll_event *events, int maxevents, int timeout);`

### key struct

* epoll_event

  ```c++
  typedef union epoll_data {
    void        *ptr;
    int          fd;
    uint32_t     u32;
    uint64_t     u64;
  }
  ```

* epoll_data

  ```c++
  struct epoll_event {
    uint32_t     events; 
    epoll_data_t data;
  };
  ```

  * events - is a bit mask composed by ORing together zero or diffrent event types(read, write and so on)
  * data - the data that the kernel should save and then return (via epoll_wait(2)) when this file descriptor becomes ready.

### example

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <sys/epoll.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <cstring>

using namespace std;

const int MAX_EVENTS = 10;
const int TIMEOUT = 5000;

int main() {
    // Create a file descriptor for reading from stdin
    int stdin_fd = fileno(stdin);

    // Set stdin to non-blocking mode
    int flags = fcntl(stdin_fd, F_GETFL, 0);
    fcntl(stdin_fd, F_SETFL, flags | O_NONBLOCK);

    // Create an epoll instance
    int epoll_fd = epoll_create1(0);
    if (epoll_fd == -1) {
        cerr << "Error creating epoll instance: " << strerror(errno) << endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Add stdin to the epoll instance
    struct epoll_event event;
    event.data.fd = stdin_fd;
    event.events = EPOLLIN | EPOLLET; // Monitor for read events and use edge-triggered mode
    if (epoll_ctl(epoll_fd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, stdin_fd, &event) == -1) {
        cerr << "Error adding file descriptor to epoll instance: " << strerror(errno) << endl;
        close(epoll_fd);
        return 1;
    }

    // Wait for events
    struct epoll_event events[MAX_EVENTS];
    int num_events = epoll_wait(epoll_fd, events, MAX_EVENTS, TIMEOUT);

    // Handle events
    for (int i = 0; i < num_events; ++i) {
        if (events[i].data.fd == stdin_fd) {
            // Read input from stdin
            char buffer[1024];
            int num_bytes = read(stdin_fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
            if (num_bytes == -1 && errno != EAGAIN) {
                cerr << "Error reading from stdin: " << strerror(errno) << endl;
                break;
            } else if (num_bytes > 0) {
                // Echo input back to stdout
                write(STDOUT_FILENO, buffer, num_bytes);
            }
        }
    }

    // Clean up
    close(epoll_fd);
    return 0;
}
```

* more details please refer [this page](https://www.ulduzsoft.com/2014/01/select-poll-epoll-practical-difference-for-system-architects/)

### poll and epoll

* `epoll` is generally considered to be more efficient and scalable than `poll`
* `poll` is its simplicity, as it requires fewer system calls and data structures than `epoll`.
* `poll` can become less efficient than `epoll` when monitoring large numbers of file descriptors, since it requires iterating over the entire list of file descriptors each time it is called.
* It differs both from *poll* and *select* in such a way that it keeps the information about the currently monitored descriptors and associated events inside the kernel, and exports the API to add/remove/modify those.
* `poll()` uses a linear list to manage the file descriptors, while `epoll()` uses a scalable data structure based on a red-black tree. 
* `poll()` blocks the calling thread until an event occurs on one of the monitored file descriptors, while `epoll()` uses an event-driven model and can be used in either blocking or non-blocking mode.

## QUIC

### reference

* [QUIC - wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC)

### what is 

* It is is a general-purpose transport layer network protocol.

### network stack

* traditional tcp
  * http - user space
  * tls - user space
  * tcp - kernel space
* QUIC
  * http - user space
  * quic - user space
    * tls - user space, and it is included in quic
  * udp - kernel space

### disadv of tcp

* head of line
  * TCP will see any error on a connection as a blocking operation, stopping further transfers until the error is resolved or the connection is considered failed.
  * If a single connection is being used to send multiple streams of data, as is the case in the HTTP/2 protocol, all of these streams are blocked although only one of them might have a problem. 
* many handshakes
  * tcp deliberately contains little understanding of the data it transmits.
  * if use tls, first we should make tcp handshakes, then make tls handshakes. So the latency may be too long.

### characteristics

* goal
  * QUIC aims to be nearly equivalent to a TCP connection but with much-reduced latency.
* simple setup
  * reduce handshake times
  * 0RTT - As tls is a part of quic in user space, you only need one RTT when you make a quic connection. Even further, you can carry message on the request connnecion, then it will be 0 RTT.
* use udp instead of tcp
  * it seperately implements loss recovery. and it is more efficient than tcp
  * it seperately implements congess control.
* improve performance during network-switching events.
  * tcp identities a connection by two ip adresses and two ports, so you'll fell a bad network when switch between wifi and cellular as it needs to reconnect.
  * quic uses connection id to identify a connection. It will reuse some context such as tls secret key to reconnect, then you will not fell a bad network.

* user space
  * less systerm call, less context switch
  * you can choose any congestion control and overtime resend algorithms you like

## Protocol Buffers

### reference

* [protocal buffer - wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Buffers)

### what is

* it is a free and open-source cross-platform data format used to serialize structured data. 
* It is useful in developing programs that communicate with each other over a network or for storing data.

### example

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

message Person {
  string name = 1;
  int32 age = 2;
  repeated string hobbies = 3;
}
```

***

## DNS

### under protocal

* UDP

### search order

* host file、client local cache、Local DNS(set default by ISP)、DNS server cache、higher level DNS server

### record types

* A - an IPv4 address
* AAAA - an IPv^ address
* CNAME - it points a hostname to another hostname.

## DNS hijacking

### reference

* [what-are-dns-spoofing-dns-hijacking-dns-cache-poisoning](https://www.infoblox.com/dns-security-resource-center/what-are-dns-spoofing-dns-hijacking-dns-cache-poisoning/)
* [dns-hijacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_hijacking)
* [DNS Hijacking of Great Firewall of China](https://www.gfwvpn.com/dns-hijacking-of-great-firewall-of-china/)

### what it?

* DNS Spoofing - It is a DNS attack that changes DNS records returned to a querier.
* DNS Hijacking - It refers to any attack that tricks the end user into thinking he or she is communicating with a legitimate domain name when in reality it is communicating with a domain name or IP address that the attacker has set up. 
* DNS Cache Poisoning - It is a DNS attack targeting caching name servers.

### ways to hijacking

* captive portal - When you use a pay-for-use wife, the hotspot service captures all DNS queries, and regardless of what was asked, it returns the IP address of the payment server so the user can purchase WiFi access.
* changing DNS server - The attacker could change the user’s DNS setting, so instead of using 8.8.8.8, it uses the IP address of a DNS server under the attacker’s control.

### How default DNS is set?

* By default, router uses DNS servers set up by your internet service provider. All the devices on your network use your router’s DNS server.

### DNS quick answer

* The DNS server use UDP 53 port to answer the request from user's computer.
* The client computer will accept the first DNS reply from remote if its data format is correct and ignore other replies.
* When you request 8.8.8.8, This request is detected and GFW returns an error IP to your computer immediately, your computer will accept this reply and ignore other replies (the real reply). 

### How to avoid?

* Use trusted DNS servers, such as Google DNS servers(8.8.8.8).
* Use VPN & Google DNS together. In this way, your DNS request will be encrypted and can't be detected by GFW.
* Modify the local host file to ensure the hijacked Domain Name will be resolved locally.

### with DNS

* it depends on the DNS CNAME record type.

* [The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5246#section-7.4.2)

### progress

1. client hello

   * request parameters

     1. client version of the SSL protocol by which the client wishes to communicate during this session.

        ```c
        ProtocolVersion client_version;
        ```

     2. random structure

        ```c
        struct {
            uint32 gmt_unix_time;
            opaque random_bytes[28];
        } Random;
        ```

     2. a variable-length session identifier

        * use for reconnect

     3. a list of the cryptographic options supported by the client

        ```c
        uint8 CipherSuite[2];
        ```

     4. a list of compression algorithms supported by the client

        ```c
        enum { null(0), (255) } CompressionMethod;

   * final request struct

     ```c
     struct {
         ProtocolVersion client_version;

         CipherSuite cipher_suites<2..2^16-1>;
         CompressionMethod compression_methods<1..2^8-1>;
     } ClientHello;
     ```

2. server hello

   ```c
   struct {
       ProtocolVersion server_version; // the highest supported by the server.
       Random random; // it is generated by the server and must be different from (and independent of) ClientHello.random.
       SessionID session_id; // the identity of the session corresponding to this connection.
       CipherSuite cipher_suite; // The single cipher suite selected by the server from the list in ClientHello.cipher_suites.
       CompressionMethod compression_method; // The single compression algorithm selected by the server from the list in client hello
   } ServerHello;
   ```

3. server certificate

   * send time
     * immediately following the server hello message.

   * request structure

     ```c
     opaque ASN.1Cert<1..2^24-1>;
     struct {
         ASN.1Cert certificate_list<1..2^24-1>; // This is a sequence (chain) of X.509.v3  certificates, 
       																				 // ordered with the sender's certificate first followed by any certificate 																							 // authority certificates proceeding sequentially upward.
     } Certificate;
     ```

4. server key exchange message

   * when will be sent?
     * immediately after the server Certificate message

   * what's for?
     * send the public key to client

5. server hello done

   * what's for?
     * it indicates the end of the server hello and associated messages.

   * why exist?
     * after sending server hello, server may also sends key exchange meaasage or certificate request. so it's necessary to tell client that server has sent all message it want to send.

   * structure

     ```c
     struct { } ServerHelloDone;
     ```

   * what will server do then?
     * After sending this message, the server will wait for a client response.

6. client key exchange message

   * when will be sent?
     * It MUST immediately follow the client certificate message, if it is sent.  Otherwise, it MUST be the first message sent by the client after it receives the ServerHelloDone message.

   * what's for?
     * set the premaster secret

   * rsa case

     * do what?
       * the client generates a 48-byte(the third random number) premaster secret, encrypts it under the public key from the server's certificate or temporary RSA key from a server key exchange message, and sends the result in an encrypted premaster secret message.
       * and that is the encrypted premaster key

     * request structure

       ```c
       struct {
           ProtocolVersion client_version;
           opaque random[46];
       } PreMasterSecret;
       struct {
           PreMasterSecret pre_master_secret; // public-key-encrypted 
       } EncryptedPreMasterSecret;
       ```

7. finished
   * feature
     1. it is always sent immediately after a change cipher spec message to verify that the key exchange and authentication processes were successful.
     2. it is the first protected with the just-negotiated algorithms, keys, and secrets.
     3. No acknowledgment of the finished message is required
     4. parties may begin sending encrypted data immediately after sending the finished message.

### master key

* real master key equals the total bottom

  ```c
  master_secret = PRF(pre_master_secret, "master secret", ClientHello.random + ServerHello.random)
  ```

  1. the first random number generated by client during client hello

  2. the second random number generated by server during server hello 

  3. the third random number which is also premaster key generated by client during client key exchage message

### why are there client and server random

* reference
  1. [replay-attack wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack)
  2. [why-does-the-ssl-tls-handshake-have-a-client-and-server-random](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/89383/why-does-the-ssl-tls-handshake-have-a-client-and-server-random)
* Only using premaster key would mean that the entire key generation routine was based on client generated values. If a Man-In-The-Middle attacker replayed the handshake, the same pre-master secret would be sent and then used for the connection.
* It's use for defending replay-attack.

## network address translation

### reference

* [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation)
* [简单几步实现内网穿透](https://sspai.com/post/73283)
* [nat-traversal](https://www.netmaker.io/resources/nat-traversal)
* [Carrier-grade NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT)
* [tailscale](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale)

### features

* NAT is almost been referred as NAPT by default.
* In most cases, a router owns a public IP. But there is alao a shortage of ipv4 addresses, so ISP owns a public ip, each router owns a private ip, and then each device owns a private ip (relative to the router). So you can't get a public ip address after installing the broadband. And this is `CGT`

### STUN Server

- Session Traversal Utilities for NAT
- Its primary job is to help a client (e.g., your computer behind your home router) discover its own **public IP address and port** as seen by the outside world, and to determine the **type of NAT** it is behind.
- **How it works (Discovery):**
  1. Your device (e.g., 192.168.1.10:50000) behind NAT A sends a UDP packet to the public STUN server.
  2. NAT A rewrites the source IP and port of this packet to its own public IP and an available port (e.g., 203.0.113.50:60000).
  3. The STUN server receives the packet from 203.0.113.50:60000.
  4. The STUN server sends a reply back to that public IP and port (203.0.113.50:60000), informing your device: "I saw your packet come from 203.0.113.50:60000."
  5. Your device now knows its private IP/port (192.168.1.10:50000) AND its public IP/port (203.0.113.50:60000).
- It does not store ips.

### Signaling Server

- This is a separate server (often a simple web server or WebSocket server) that helps the two parties (peers) *exchange* the IP address and port combinations they've discovered (both private and public ones, obtained via STUN).
- Peer A tells the Signaling Server: "Here are my possible addresses: 192.168.1.10:50000 (private), 203.0.113.50:60000 (public)."

### UDP Hole Punching

- When an internal client sends an *outgoing* UDP packet to an *external* server, the NAT router creates a temporary "hole" or mapping in its firewall for that specific outbound connection. This hole will then allow *incoming* UDP packets from that *same external destination* to reach the internal client for a limited time.
- **How it works (Communication):**
  1. Peer A (knowing Peer B's public IP/port) starts sending UDP packets directly to Peer B's public IP/port.
  2. Simultaneously, Peer B (knowing Peer A's public IP/port) also starts sending UDP packets directly to Peer A's public IP/port.
  3. The outgoing packets from A to B create a hole in NAT A.
  4. The outgoing packets from B to A create a hole in NAT B.
  5. Once these "holes" are punched by *outbound* traffic from both sides, an incoming packet from the other peer can now pass through the respective NAT.
  6. Once the first packet gets through, a direct peer-to-peer connection is established.

### TURN Server

- Traversal Using Relays around NAT
- **Role:** Used as a fallback when UDP hole punching fails (e.g., due to very strict NAT types like Symmetric NAT).
- **How it works (Relaying):** If direct peer-to-peer communication can't be established, both clients establish a connection to a public TURN server. All subsequent communication between Peer A and Peer B is then **relayed** through the TURN server.
- **Does it store IPs?** Yes, the TURN server acts as a full relay, receiving data from one peer and forwarding it to the other. It knows the public IP/port of both peers and constantly processes their traffic.

## AP

### what?

* A hardware device that creates a wireless local area network (**WLAN**), allowing Wi-Fi-enabled devices (like smartphones, laptops, and smart home gadgets) to connect to a network.
* It is a **physical** device or component in a router that provides Wi-Fi access to devices by connecting them to a wired network (e.g., Ethernet).

### ap vs router

* **Router**: Combines routing (managing data between devices) and access point functionality.
* **Access Point**: A device purely for extending or creating wireless coverage. It doesn’t manage network traffic or provide routing functions.

### connection

* via an Ethernet cable. It stable, fast and high capacity.
* Wireless Connection. It is very convenient.
  * 假設Router覆蓋範圍10米，AP覆蓋範圍5米。則你可以在距離Router 9 米的地方放置一個AP並通過無線連接，這樣理論就可以在距離Router 14米的地方進行上網。

## wifi mesh

### what?

* It is an **abstract** concept or topology for Wi-Fi network deployment. Its goal is to ensure seamless and consistent Wi-Fi coverage across a large area by connecting multiple nodes.

### features

* Each node broadcasts the same network name (SSID), allowing devices to move between nodes without losing connection. Devices switch between nodes without dropping the connection, offering a smooth user experience.
* The system dynamically determines the best path for data, ensuring strong connections for all devices. If one node fails or becomes overloaded, traffic is rerouted through other nodes.

### vs ap

| Concept      | Type     | Purpose                                                | Examples in wifi mesh                        |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Access Point | physical | Provides Wi-Fi access to devices                       | Mesh nodes act as APs to extend coverage     |
| Wifi mesh    | abstract | Seamless network with unified SSID and dynamic routing | Uses APs to create a cohesive “mesh” network |

### SSID

* **SSID (Service Set Identifier)** is the name assigned to a Wi-Fi network, making it identifiable to devices trying to connect. When you search for available Wi-Fi networks on your phone or computer, the list of network names you see consists of their SSIDs.

* examples in wifi mesh

  > If your router has the SSID **“HomeWiFi”**, your phone or laptop will list **“HomeWiFi”** as a network option.
  >
  > In a mesh system, even if there are multiple nodes (APs), all will share the same SSID **“HomeWiFi”**, so your device doesn’t have to reconnect when moving around.
